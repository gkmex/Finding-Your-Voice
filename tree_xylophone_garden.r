#Finding Your Voice

#1. Set a Goal
#Setting a goal is the first step in finding your voice. Think about what you want to accomplish. It could be anything from finding a new job to becoming a better public speaker or writing a book. Whatever it is, write it down so you can refer back to it as you work to find your voice.

#2. Make a List
#Make a list of all the experiences you have that have helped to shape who you are today. This could include past jobs, interests, hobbies, and even relationships. This list can give you insight into what kind of voice you already have, and can serve as a launching pad for you to begin finding your true voice.

#3. Take a Step Back 
#It can be helpful to take a step back and assess the bigger picture. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish in the long term, and use this to shape the direction that you take while finding your voice.

#4. Get Inspired
#Find inspiration by reading books, watching videos, listening to podcasts, attending conferences and attending talks. All of these activities can help you fill in the blanks about who you are and help you find your voice.

#5. Make Connections
#Start connecting with people who have similar backgrounds and interests as you. Connecting with others can help you gain a new perspective and open up possibilities you may never have thought of before.

#6. Experiment
#Experiment with different ways of expressing yourself. Try writing in different styles, talking in different tones, or developing different strategies in the way you communicate. This kind of exploration can help you find the type of voice you want to have.

#7. Reach Out
#Seek advice from people who have a similar voice to the one you’re looking for. Ask them questions about their experiences and take their advice into consideration as you continue to shape your own voice.

#8. Practice
#Practice speaking in different situations, writing in different styles, and using different ways of expressing yourself. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will become with your voice.

#9. Monitor Progress
#Track your progress and keep an eye on the goals you’ve set. Monitor the changes you’ve made, and determine what to keep and what to tweak as you continue to find your voice.

#10. Stay True to Yourself
#As you work to find your voice, remember to stay true to who you are. Don’t be afraid to be yourself, and never compromise your beliefs or values in the process.
